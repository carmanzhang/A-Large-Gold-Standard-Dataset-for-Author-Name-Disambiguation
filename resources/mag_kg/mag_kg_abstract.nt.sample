There were 4 female and 6 male patients. Mean age atsurgery was 8 years and 9 months. Regarding motor involvement,6 patients were hemiplegic, 2, diplegic and 2 patients had mixedtype cerebral palsy. Mean follow-up was 26 months. Associatedsurgeries were performed in 92% of the cases (11 feet). Goodresults were achieved in 67% of the cases and regular results in25% . There was one bad result (8%). None of the feet develo-ped a calcaneovalgus deformity. Regular and bad results weremainly associated to anterior tibial insufficiency, leading to themaintenance of the orthosis; the influence of other deformingforces on the foot besides the posterior tibial and to the presen-ce of structural bony deformities. The technique of hemitranspo-sition of tibial posterior tendon, associated to other proceduresas indicated, leads to good results in correcting spastic varusdeformity of the foot in cerebral palsy. Dynamic components ofthe deformity need to be determined pre-operatively and struc-tural bony deformities must be corrected concomitantly.Keywords: Cerebral palsy; Varus foot; Muscle Spasticity."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

ITO: the reactivity of AO causes recrystallization of the ITO nanograins along the interface between the ITO and substrate, which would negatively affect the film adhesion. Si: Remarkably homogeneous and uniform oxides form that are thicker and more ordered towards the alpha quartz structure than the oxide formed by O2 exposure, due to the high reactivity of the AO and its kinetic energy. Ge: The effect of the AO is to produce smaller nanograins of crystalline GeO2 as compared to 02, where increasing the kinetic energy increases the oxide thickness. Al: The AO causes initial vaporization and corresponding roughening of the Al surface prior to the growth of the amorphous oxide scale, which could be due to the information of gaseous and stable AlO2."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Proper management of natural resources is essential if economic benefits are to be balanced against environmental costs.

The model was progressively refined to more micro and complex versions associated with smaller geographical regions and shorter time increments. Water planning models are used to assess effectiveness of potential management policies.

The centrality dependence of charged hadron multiplicity d N ch / d &#x03B7; at midrapidity was found quite sensitive to the largely uncertain gluon shadowing parameter s g that determines the nuclear modification of the gluon distribution. We find final-state parton scatterings reduce considerably hadron yield at midrapidity and enforces a smaller gluon shadowing to be consistent with d N ch / d &#x03B7; data at LHC. With such a constrained parton shadowing, charged hadron and neutral pion production over a wide transverse momenta range are investigated in AMPT. Relative to nucleon&#x2013;nucleon collisions, the particle yield in central heavy ion collisions is suppressed due to parton energy loss. While the calculated magnitude and pattern of suppression is found consistent with that measured in Au&#x00A0;+&#x00A0;Au collisions at s NN = 0.2 TeV at RHIC, at the LHC energy the suppression is overpredicted which may imply the medium formed at LHC is less opaque than expected from simple RHIC extrapolations. Reduction of the QCD coupling constant &#x03B1; s by &#x223C; 30 % in the higher temperature plasma formed at LHC as compared to that at RHIC was found to reproduce the measured suppression at LHC."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

He then looks at the metaphysical structure that supports this way of being, and explores three core categories: transcendence, relationality, and corporeality. These underpin relationships according to the pattern of the Trinity that take people in relationship beyond themselves individually, and, at the same time, beyond their mutual relatedness. This is a different way of being human that also opens up the possibility of a different way of knowing. It is always helpful to avoid over generalization. Nonetheless this should not discourage us from considering the various contemporary analyses of innovative cultural prospects characterized, at least in the West, by a recovery of the original stimuli for philosophical thinking. After centuries of neglect, when there was a monopoly of logos understood as rational activity detached from life itself, philosophical discourse speaks again about love or eros. Philosophy, it is said, must be again the love of wisdom. It must rediscover, therefore, its creative impulse in love. It comes as no surprise, then, to see expressions summarizing contemporary cultural sensibility as being rather like &#x201C;a mystical shift in philosophy&#x201D; or &#x201C;a theological shift in phenomenology.&#x201D;1 This is not a passing phase. It comes from processes of thought over the years that indicates something of the complexity of cultural shifts. For example, we would not be able to speak of a theological or mystical shift in phenomenology without considering the thought of the later Heidegger. This perspective introduces the appeal to transcendence, to &#x201C;the event&#x201D; (Ereignis), to love, to the body, to life, to poetical thinking and to the divine. 2 Another characteristic of this new way of facing the human can be seen in the ontological hermeneutics of religious experience.

Several authors have proposed an integrated approach to the regulation of markets for stolen property. Understanding property crime as a market is central to identifying approaches to its control. This paper discusses an industry model of crime and develops it on Australian data. Our model is an adaptation of one originally proposed by Vandeale (1978). It considers a production sector that uses inputs from a market of illegal labour to generate a supply of illegal goods that are traded in a product market.

The noninvasive models, because of their simplicity and high level of reproducibility, are ideally suited for studies directed at characterizing cell biological events that lead to cell injury. The in vivo invasive models, particularly the ductinjection model of Aho et al. and the opossum duct ligation model, are attractive because they appear to be clinically relevant in terms of their etiology and they lead to severe pancreatitis, permitting studies evaluating local as well as systemic complications of pancreatitis.

ABSTRACT Engineers use different methods to determine rainfall intensity specific duration and return periods in drainage projects, the most relevant being the Gumbel method, the Log-Pearson Type III Distribution, and the Graphic Method, which are the methods most often used in Venezuela. The main objective of this research is to compare the different methods used in forecasting maximum rainfall intensity for hydraulic structure design. To achieve this purpose, all three methods were applied to twelve pluviographic stations in eastern Venezuela. Results show that the maximum precipitation intensity values were obtained for the 2, 5, and 10 year return periods using both the Gumbel and Log-Pearson Type III methods, and for 25, 50, and 100 years of return period using the Graphic method. These results suggest that the Gumbel and the Log-Pearson Type III Distribution methods are applicable for return periods of up to 25 years, whereas the Graphic method should be used for periods above 25 years.

The recovery pattern of the induced cataract was also investigated. METHODS. Aseptically dissected porcine lenses were cultured in glass chambers. At 1 week, lenses were exposed to a predetermined UV energy (J/cm 2 ) at specific wavebands ranging from 270 to 370 nm at 5- and 10-nm intervals. The UV energy was generated by a PRA integrated arc lamp system using a water-cooled 1000 W, high-pressure xenon lamp. The lamp output was limited using a deionized water filter, a monochromator, and secondary optics. An electronic shutter was used to control the exposure time. The median effective dose, ED 50 (i.e., UV energy threshold) for each waveband was statistically determined using probit analysis. Irradiated spots (3.06 mm 2 ) on the lenses were monitored every 6 to 12 hours up to 48 hours postirradiation for any UV-induced opacity with a dissecting microscope and photomicrography. The ED 50 s were plotted against wavelengths to obtain the action spectrum. RESULTS. The threshold values for 270, 300, and 365 nm were 0.057, 0.069, and 137.19 J/cm 2 , respectively. Permanent UV-induced cataract was obtained at twice the threshold values for UVB and UVA. CONCLUSIONS. An action spectrum for in vitro UV-induced cataract using whole cultured lens is established. These data are comparable to published in vitro (with isolated lens epithelial cells) and in vivo action spectra. The recovery pattern appears to he similar to the in vivo situation."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

En nuestro hospital se realizan procedimientos quirurgicos el mismo dia del ingreso lo que impide una visita preoperatoria por parte de enfermeria. Esto nos hizo plantearnos el siguiente trabajo con el OBJETIVO de comprobar el aumento de ansiedad del paciente con el tiempo de espera en la antesala del quirofano y evaluar si el aumento de ansiedad en ese mismo tiempo se manifestaba somaticamente a traves de la tension arterial y frecuencia cardiaca. MATERIAL Y METODO. Muestra de 68 pacientes intervenidos de cirugia abdominal no oncologica. Estudio transversal con 2 determinaciones, la primera en el momento que llega el paciente a la antesala de quirofano y la segunda justo cuando va a pasar a quirofano. La ansiedad se evaluo con la escala del inventario Ansiedad-Estado de Ch. Spielberger version espanola; se tomaron las constantes tension arterial y frecuencia cardiaca y se anoto la hora de llegada y al pasar al quirofano. RESULTADOS. Se observo un aumento de ansiedad y tension arterial entre la llegada y el momento de pasar, no asi en la frecuencia cardiaca. No obstante no se ha podido demostrar que el tiempo de espera prequirurgico fuese significativo para estas variables. Si se se vio una diferencia significativa en la ansiedad entre mujeres y hombres siendo mayor en los hombres en el momento de pasar al quirofano. CONCLUSIONES. El tiempo de espera prequirurgico no es un factor asociado al aumento de la ansiedad, en cambio si se puede asegurar que el genero si esta asociado. La intervencion de la enfermeria previamente a la intervencion podria predecir la ansiedad de los pacientes mediante test simples y reducirla en una ambiente de confianza y seguridad para ellos. EnglishINTRODUCTION. In our hospital, surgical procedures are performed the same day of admission, which makes no possible a preoperative visit by nurses. For this reason we proposed the following work. The main OBJETIVE was to evaluate the amount in patient&#039;s anxiety the related with the time waiting out of the operating room just before surgery and to assess whether the amount of anxiety was manifested through blood pressure and heart rate variations. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 68 patients undergoing abdominal non oncologic surgery were recruited. A Cross-sectional study, with two determinations: the first at the time the patient reaches pre operating room and the second when passed to the operating room. Anxiety was assessed with the scale of the State Anxiety Inventory Spielberger Ch Spanish version. Also, blood pressure, heart rate, and noted the time of arrival and moving on to the operating room. RESULTS. There was an increase in anxiety and blood pressure between arrival and the beginning of the surgery, but there was no difference in heart rate. However the preoperative waiting time was not stadistical significant for these variables. There was a significant difference in anxiety between men and women, being higher in men at the time to move on to the operating room. CONCLUSIONS. The preoperative waiting time is not a factor associated with increased anxiety, however the male sex is associated with higher anxiety."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Application of Sliding Mode Control [2, 3] in tracking a real-time voltage profile is very promising because a switching control strategy is traditionally employed in power converters, and because of the inherent robustness properties of the sliding mode. Contributions to sliding mode control [2, 3] of power converters are available in many papers [l, 4, 5, 10]. Direct regulation/tracking control of the output voltage for boost and buck-boost power converters results in a nonminimum phase system and therefore an unstable controller. It has been shown in [6, 7, 9, 17, 18, 21] that controlling the current can indirectly control the output voltage in both converters. In particular, a variable unknown load was considered in [18, 21] using an optimal estimator."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

This technique allows separate determinations of the optical mean thickness, the average refractive index and the adsorbed amount of an adsorbed polymer film. The low optical contrast of the water-EHEC-polystyrene system makes measurements of these quantities difficult, but we show that they can be determined with sufficient accuracy by using a modern high precision ellipsometer. At room temperature, EHEC adsorbs sparsely on polystyrene surfaces (&#x0393;=lmg/m 2 ), forming layers with an optical mean thickness that slightly exceeds 30 nm. Raising the temperature results in increasing adsorption and a simultaneous contraction of the adsorbed layer. The conjunction of these opposing trends leads to a strong decrease of the ellipsometric thickness near the bulk phase separation temperature at this surface. The adsorbed layer contains a fraction highly extended but dilute tails, reflected by its large hydrodynamic extension, as observed by photon correlation spectroscopy measurements (&#x03B4; h &#x03B4;110 nm at 20&#x00B0;C). This fraction, however, does not significantly affect the interaction forces between two EHEC coated surfaces."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The methodology is intended as an attempt to move beyond visualisations which are simply believable towards a more physically accurate approach. Accurate representations of polychrome statuary have great potential utility both as a means of illustrating existing interpretations and as a means of testing and revising developing hypotheses. The goal of this methodology is to propose a pipeline which incorporates a high degree of physical accuracy whilst also being practically applicable in a conventional archaeological research setting. The methodology is designed to allow the accurate visualisation of surviving objects and colourants as well as providing reliable methods for the hypothetical reconstruction of elements which no longer survive. The process proposed here is intended to limit the need for specialist recording equipment, utilising existing data and those data which can be collected using widely available technology.

Forty-one depths at eleven stations along nine transects were sampled simultaneously at hourly intervals for salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorohyll a , particulate nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite, total kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia, particulate carbohydrate, dissolved organic carbon, total hydrolizable phosphorous, dissolved inorganic phosphorous, suspended sediment, particle size distribution, and zooplankton. Tidal velocity was continuously monitored at each depth by recording current meters. Riverine input and meteorological conditions were relatively stable for two weeks preceeding the deployment. This communication describes the calculation of the intrinsic rates of change of the observed variables from their measured distributions in the Estuary. The steady-state, one-dimensional equation of species continuity is employed to separate the advection and tidal dispersion of a hydrodynamically passive substance from its intrinsic rate of change at point. A new spatial transform is introduced for the purpose of interpolation and extrapolation of data. The intrinsic rate of change profiles reveal a region of heavy bloom activity in the upper estuary and a secondary bloom near the point in the River that most of the suspended material settles out. The changes in Ammonia and nitrates are highly correlated to the productivity patterns. Phosphorous rates are less closely correlated to productivity. The perturbations that the Chalk Point steam electric power plant have on the heat and oxygen balances are easily discernible."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<http://ma-graph.org/entity/1857> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract> "Our studies show that the making of fibroin by mechanically stimulated spider glands seems to require a series of well-orchestrated gene expressions. Monitoring of the process through time sequence has revealed four transient waves of molecular syntheses. The last and most dramatic of these events is the synthesis of the full-size fibroin product, which is preceded by a wave which generates template RNA by a 60-min interval. The other two events generate small RNAs. Analyses of the first of the small RNA-generating bouts, consistently of higher magnitude than the subsequent one, displays upgrading of 5S RNA, to a higher extent of Ul snRNA, and a dramatic boost in alanine transfer RNA (tRNA) accumulation. This tRNA resolves into two isoforms, one of which is gland-specific and quantitatively correlated to its fibroin-synthesizing activity. The second of these waves serves to optimize the gland&#x2019;s translational milieu through the differential expression of the tRNAs cognate to the most preponderant amino acids of the gland&#x2019;s fibroin product in a similar proportion to that in which these appear in the fibroin. Worthy of note is the disproportionate accumulation of alanine-tRNA which is produced primarily within the first wave of small RNA syntheses and which selectively enriches the system with a tissue-specific isoacceptor species in a proportion of 4:1 to its constitutive counterpart. The nucleotide sequence of this isoform endows it with structural features which foster its possible performance in other than elongation functions during the synthesis of fibroin."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<http://ma-graph.org/entity/2178> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract> "The effective daylighting of multistorey commercial building interiors poses an interesting problem for designers in Australia&#x2019;s tropical and subtropical context. Given that a building exterior receives adequate sun and skylight as dictated by location-specific factors such as weather, siting and external obstructions; then the availability of daylight throughout its interior is dependant on certain building characteristics: the distance from a window facade (room depth), ceiling or window head height, window size and the visible transmittance of daylighting apertures. The daylighting of general stock, multistorey commercial buildings is made difficult by their design limitations with respect to some of these characteristics. The admission of daylight to these interiors is usually exclusively by vertical windows. Using conventional glazing, such windows can only admit sun and skylight to a depth of approximately 2 times the window height. This penetration depth is typically much less than the depth of the office interiors, so that core areas of these buildings receive little or no daylight. This issue is particularly relevant where deep, open plan office layouts prevail. The resulting interior daylight pattern is a relatively narrow perimeter zone bathed in (sometimes too intense) light, contrasted with a poorly daylit core zone. The broad luminance range this may present to a building occupant&#x2019;s visual field can be a source of discomfort glare. Furthermore, the need in most tropical and subtropical regions to restrict solar heat gains to building interiors for much of the year has resulted in the widespread use of heavily tinted or reflective glazing on commercial building facades. This strategy reduces the amount of solar radiation admitted to the interior, thereby decreasing daylight levels proportionately throughout. However this technique does little to improve the way light is distributed throughout the office space. Where clear skies dominate weather conditions, at different times of day or year direct sunlight may pass unobstructed through vertical windows causing disability or discomfort glare for building occupants and as such, its admission to an interior must be appropriately controlled. Any daylighting system to be applied to multistorey commercial buildings must consider these design obstacles, and attempt to improve the distribution of daylight throughout these deep, sidelit office spaces without causing glare conditions. The research described in this thesis delineates first the design optimisation and then the actual prototyping and manufacture process of a daylighting device to be applied to such multistorey buildings in tropical and subtropical environments."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

One worker developed a severe asthma attack following initial exposure to the resin, Du-Pont FASLOC, and was diagnosed by two pulmonary medicine specialists as having occupationally induced asthma. Sensitization to the resin or its components was not tested. Three other workers reported headaches, sore throats, and coughs following exposure. All four were interviewed, and medical histories were requested but only one was obtained. Air samples were taken near machine operators&#039; breathing zones and downwind of vapors during roof bolting. These were analyzed for resin components, styrene, vinyl-toluene, or butyl benzyl phthalate. There were no detectable levels of the latter two chemicals, and styrene was present near the detection limit of 0.05 parts per million. The authors conclude that there is no health risk to the general work force from this resin.

A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A MEME Liane Gabora Center for the Study of the Evolution and Origin of Life University of California, Los Angeles Los Angeles, CA 90095-1567 liane@cs.ucla.edu 1. CONCEPTUAL CHANGE: A SECOND FORM OF EVOLUTION Knowing everything there is to know about how concepts or ideas can get represented in the mind of an individual would not take us far toward an account of why individuals understand the world the way they do, or explain why their understanding differs from that of their ancestors. While some ideas fade into obscurity, others rise to prominence and spread horizontally through society, and vertically from one generation to another, getting progressively refined and embellished along the way. Ideas, like the strands of DNA that encode instructions for building and maintaining living organisms, seem to undergo a process analogous to biological evolution. Understanding this process is a vital part of unraveling our cognitive make-up. There has been a slow but steady effort to map the concept of evolution onto the dynamics of culture. Popper (1963) and Campbell (1987) alerted us to the evolutionary flavor of epistemology. Dawkins (1976) introduced the notion of a meme--a replicator of cultural information analogous to the gene. In his words: &quot;Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperm or eggs, so do memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain.&quot; Others have drawn from mathematical models of population genetics and epidemiology to model the spread of ideas (Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman 1981; Lumsden &amp; Wilson 1981; Schuster &amp; Sigmund 1983; Boyd &amp; Richerson 1985; Hofbauer &amp; Sigmund 1988). These works point toward the possibility that memetics constitutes a second form of evolution, distinct from yet intertwined with biological evolution, with the potential to provide the kind of overarching framework for the social and cognitive sciences that the first form provides for the biological sciences. However thus far memetics has not lived up to this potential, a situation that seems unfortunate given the success of the biological precedent. Although much was known about living things before Darwin, his theory of how life evolves through natural selection united previously disparate phenomena and paved the way for further biological inquiry."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

We observed that lethally irradiated SJL/J mice given a single injection of HUCB cells survive, whereas vehicle-injected mice do not. Because survival is not due to long-term engraftment of HUCB cells, we used this HUCB/mouse model to investigate additional therapeutic benefits of HUCB cells. We investigated the mechanism by which HUCB cells accelerated endogenous hematopoiesis in mice that received either lethal (9.5 Gy) or lower-dose (8.0 Gy) radiation and then were given a single injection of HUCB mononuclear cells. Compared to irradiated control mice, the lethally irradiated, HUCB-injected group showed significant increases in peripheral white blood cell counts, red blood cell indices, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) by 3 weeks. In contrast, no significant differences in these parameters were observed between control and HUCB-injected mice that received the lower dose of irradiation. Moreover, regardless of the radiation dose, only HUCB-injected mice exhibited immune responses comparable to those of age-matched normal mice. The clinical relevance of these observations was determined in long-term, culture-initiating cell assays with human BM stem cells and irradiated (&#x03B3;-) HUCB cells. CFU-GM colonies were detectable in cultures containing &#x03B3;-HUCB cells by day 15, but were undetectable in cultures without &#x03B3;-HUCB cells until day 40, suggesting a hematopoietic stimulatory role for HUCB cells. Overall, the results indicate that in addition to their use for transplantation, HUCB cells also may be used as an adjuvant therapy to enhance hematopoietic reconstitution and immunocompetence of the host. This hematopoiesis-enhancing effect represents a heretofore unrecognized function of HUCB cells."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

It can infect an amazing diverse variety of plants but it is most noted for the serious losses that it causes in the fresh fruit, vegetable and cut flower industries The air-borne conidia germinating on plant surfaces either cause an immediate damaging, necrotrophic rot in growing plants or, they remain localized in the outer tissues until harvest and shipment where upon the organism then becomes invasive causing considerable post harvest losses. Although losses can be minimised by repeated applications of fungicides throughout the growing season there are increasing environmental and economic concerns about the prophylactic use of fungicides particularly with respect to fresh fruits and vegetables where fungicide residues have been detected. In order to target fungicide applications to the periods of highest risk and thereby reduce the number of spray applications during the growing season, we need to be able to measure not only the environmental factors that have the greatest effect on the spread of the conidia and development of the disease but also quantify the numbers of air-borne spores present at high risk times so that disease forecasting models can be made more accurate. Information on levels of air-borne conidia would also be invaluable in determining the growth stage and route by which quiescent infections are initiated. Furthermore, in order to minimize post harvest losses we also need to be able to detect symptomless infections before shipment of produce.

In order to have a good set of point of views, I chose some employees belonging to the organizational-administrative side and some others to the health one.
The main results can be placed on three main levels.
From a micro point of view I pointed out that the system crash was associated with some relevant phenomena concerning the individual and the relational sphere of the employees, even if with important a between the administrative employees and the health ones. Everyone asserted the absolute necessity of computers and information system, however while administrative employees assumed the importance of such technology simply as an exploitable mean, on the other side the health workers considered the same technology and the computerized objects as something more, that is as entities contributing to the construction of their own professional identity and activity. As a result, the system failure generates a greater sense of anxiety and a notable increase of social interactions as the result of the sudden creation of two new patients looking for some treatment: the health worker, assumed as an hybrid entity temporarily crippled, and the computer or the information system itself, that does not work or does not work properly.
From a mesoscopic point of view, the workers constantly attempted to locate the cause of the computer crash in the process of innovation that regards the implementation of the computerized infrastructure that occurred in the last 7 years. As the outcome of that innovation process is described as the result of disputes, conflicts and negotiations between many actors, there is a common propensity to underline an association of the computer system failure with an organizational failure.
Finally, from a macro point of view, the whole accounts showed to be directed towards a common perspective that assumes computer systems as a characteristic element of modernity, whose management is a prerogative of hi-tech personnel."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The organism required ammonium salts and glucose to co-metabolize the dye. Organic nitrogen sources did not support appreciable decolourization whereas, combined with inorganic nitrogen (NH4NO3) there was an increased effect on both growth and decolourization. Decolourization of this dye started when the organism reached late exponential growth phase and after 24 h of incubation nearly 90% of 100 mg l&#x2212;1 of the dye was decolourized.

More-effective interventions to reduce the burden of cancer can be developed and implemented by the adoption of a transdisciplinary research framework that takes into account the social determinants of cancer and seeks to discover interactions among social, environmental, behavioral, and biological factors in cancer etiology. This paper addresses two critical issues in the science of team science: (1) a cross-disciplinary, multilevel framework for organizing future research, and (2) a perspective that could aid in the translation and dissemination of cancer research findings in health care and public health practice. This conceptual framework is designed to encourage transdisciplinary research that will integrate social determinants into cancer research. The authors&#039; goal is to promote a more complete understanding of the causes of cancer that will lead to the improved translation and implementation of the results of research.

Nonspecific trauma was the most frequently reported known cause of mortality in both sexes and all age classes by elk producers. Ranked on perceived economic importance, producers cited trauma, chronic wasting disease, calf scours, dystocia, pneumonia, winter tick, tuberculosis, and grain overload. One-year mortality rates for adults and yearlings were 2.6% and 2.7%, respectively. Mortality rates for male and female adult animals were 2.4% and 2.7%, respectively.

Ascorbic acid at 40 mM concentration decreased pH of extraction buffer thereby inhibiting activity of polyphenol oxidase which converts colourless polyphenols to coloured black-brown compounds tannins and melanins. Genomic DNA obtained is superior with respect to quality and quantity to be used for analytical applications.

Le beurre des divers lots de graines a ete extrait au soxhlet et ses caracteristiques physico-chimiques determinees. Les resultats obtenus au cours de ce travail ont montre qu&#x2019;au cours du stockage, les graines bouillies sont plus degradees que les graines torrefiees tandis que les graines non traitees ne le sont pas. La degradation des graines n&#x2019;a pas entraine la diminution de la teneur en huile des graines d&#x2019;un lot a un autre soit 48,66 %, 48,68 % et 50,27 % respectivement pour les graines torrefiees, bouillies et non traitees. Neanmoins, on note une augmentation de l&#x2019;acidite des beurres qui en sont extraits qui varie de 1,31 a 6,51 % d&#x2019;acide oleique pour les graines bouillies, de 0,52 a 6,98 pour les graines torrefiees et de 4,73 a 31,55 pour les graines non traitees.

EVALUATION OF THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL QUALITY OF BUTTER FROM PENTADESMA BUTYRACEA SABINE STORED SEEDS Pentadesma butyracea Sabine seeds are stored in jute bags, basins, baskets and sometimes on the ground before being transformed according to the availability of producers. During storage, the seeds undergo the attack of insects. This affects the quality and the quantity of extracted butter. To confirm this hypothesis, seeds having undergone or not various&#x00A0; pretreatments after the collecting, and which were degraded during storage were sorted and classified. The butter of the various batches of seeds was then extracted using the soxhlet method and its physicochemical characteristics was determined. The results showed that during storage, the boiled seeds were more degraded than that roasted, while untreated seeds were safe. Pretreatments reduced the oil content of seeds to a maximum of 48.66 %, 48.68 % and 50.27% for roasted, boiled and untreated seeds respectively. The degradation of seeds had no effect on reducing the oil content of seeds. However, the acidity of extracted butter increased, ranging from 1.31 to 6.51 % oleic acid, from 0.52 to 6.98 and from 4.73 to 31.55 for boiled, roasted and untreated seeds respectively. On the other hand, the moisture content of seeds and the refractive index of butters were not changed. It appears from this work that, to ensure the quality of extracted butter, the seeds should be treated and stored under conditions limiting attack of the insects. Therefore, the dried seeds could be stored in polyethylene plastic bags. Keywords : Pentadesma butyracea , seeds, butter, storage, quality."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

With the advent of the energy crisis in the seventies, city lighting has emerged nation-wide as a practical target for energy conservation effort, which unfortunately often lack definitive planning. In Gainesville, large differences exist between the needs demanded in areas with little or no lighting and areas that are over designed. These extreme lighting variations coupled with a limited corporate knowledge of the basic principles of City lighting throughout the City and State is indicative of a policy and planning vacuum in dealing with City lighting policy. Primarily, this project was envisioned as an opportunity to improve knowledge of lighting, whether as street, security, or aesthetic, gained from experts in the City of Gainesville, throughout the State of Florida and through research."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Internet music transmissions are likely to reshape the ways in which music is both created and delivered to consumers, although there is little agreement on which new model or models will emerge as predominant in the music industry. Copyright law should facilitate the development of legitimate dissemination of music over the Internet because such dissemination promises to significantly increase public access to copyrighted music. Copyright law, which fundamentally strives to increase the accessibility of creative works, should help rather than hinder dissemination of music over the Internet because of its potential for increasing the availability of music to users. Part I of the Article explains current copyright law governing music transmissions over the Internet. This existing legal framework is a very complex patchwork of overlapping and interacting provisions that have been shaped by a century of legislation and business practices, most of which developed in an era of traditional, non-networked exploitation of music. Part II examines how applying copyright law to downloading and streaming audio, the two major types of Internet music transmissions today, makes it very difficult for Internet transmitters to make such transmissions legally, even if their activities come within a copyright exemption or compulsory license. Current copyright law poses two main types of problems for those who wish to legitimately disseminate music over the Internet. First, there are transactions cost and potential &quot;hold out&quot; problems. Because any single piece of recorded music usually embodies two separate copyrighted works, and because transmitting that music over the Internet may involve two separate rights in each of those works, and because each right in each work may be owned by a different entity, the transactions costs involved in obtaining permission to transmit any volume of recorded music over the Internet can be significant. Second, although Congress has crafted a number of copyright exemptions and compulsory licenses in order to encourage activities that it concluded should not be under the exclusive control of copyright owners, Internet transmissions - by simultaneously implicating more than one right of the copyright owners - may make it impossible to engage in such Congressionally sanctioned activities without obtaining additional permission from a copyright owner, thus reducing the usefulness of, or entirely nullifying, the licenses and exemptions Congress granted. Finally, Part III suggests and evaluates possible solutions to these problems that would continue to protect copyright owners&#039; ability to exploit their works while making legitimate Internet music transmissions more feasible for users of those works. The article recommends, at the least, extending existing compulsory licenses and exemptions for digital performance transmissions of sound recordings to also cover all incidental RAM storage of any copyrighted work in the course of those transmissions."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

It helps forecast travel characteristics into the future at various planning levels such as state, region and corridor. Using TDM to evaluate different situations (changes in land use and/or transportation network) would allow the staff of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to make educated decisions regarding growth and improvements to their respective regional transportation networks. Several small (50,000&lt; population &lt;200,000) and medium (200,000 &lt;population &lt;500,000) sized MPOs in the state of Illinois utilize TDM for different transportation planning purposes, most commonly, the Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) and Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). Some of the small and medium sized MPOs in the state of Illinois are unable to utilize TDM tools primarily due to lack of available resources and guidelines at the regional and state level. This study sought to establish the framework necessary for the development, maintenance, and application of small and medium sized MPOs&#x2019; TDMs. It is crucial for the local, regional, and state agencies to play a collaborative role in the transportation planning process. This study established a framework for developing TDMs at the MPO regional level considering their limited available resources. Special attention was given to simplicity and accuracy of the travel model development process. Extensive calibration and validation checks were recommended, as accuracy of travel forecasting is of high importance. As an important part of this study, a statewide group, the Illinois Modeling Users Group (IL-MUG) was created to support, set standards and guide the development, implementation, and maintenance of TDMs in small and medium sized MPOs in Illinois."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<http://ma-graph.org/entity/5473> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract> "Popper&#039;s account of refutation is the linchpin of his famous view that the method of science is the method of conjecture and refutation. This thesis critically examines his account of refutation, and in particular the practice he deprecates as avoiding a refutation. I try to explain how he comes to hold the views that he does about these matters; how he seeks to make them plausible; how he has influenced others to accept his mistakes, and how some of the ideas or responses to Popper of such people are thus similarly mistaken. I draw some distinctions necessary to the provision of an adequate account of the so-called practice of avoiding a refutation, and try to rid the debate about this practice of at least one red herring. I analyse one case of &#039;avoiding&#039; a refutation in detail to show how the rationality of scientific practice eludes both Popper and many of his commentators. Popper&#039;s skepticism about contingent knowledge prevents him from providing an acceptable account of contingent refutation, and so his method is really the method of conjecture and conjecture. He cannot do without the concepts of knowledge and refutation, however, if his account of science is to be plausible or persuasive, and so he equivocates between, amongst other things, refutation as disproof and refutation as the weaker notion of discorroboration. I criticise David Stove&#039;s account of this matter, in particular to show how he misses this point. An additional advantage Popper would secure from this equivocation is that if refutations were mere discorroborations they would be easier to achieve, and hence more common in science, than is the case. On Popper&#039;s weak notion of refutation, it would be possible to refute true theories since corroboration does not entail truth. There are two other related doctrines Popper holds about refutation which, if accepted, make some refutations seem easier to obtain than is the case. I call these doctrines &#039;Strong Popperian Falsificationism&#039; (SPF) and &#039;Weak Popperian Falsificationism&#039; (WPF). SPF is the false doctrine that if a prediction from some theory is refuted then that theory is refuted. Popper does not always endorse SPF. In particular, when confronted with a counterexample to it, he retreats to WPF, which is the false doctrine that if a prediction from some theory is refuted then that theory is prima facie refuted. WPF , or even SPF, can seem plausible if one has in mind predictions derived from theories in strong or conclusive tests of those theories, which I suggest Popper characteristically does. Popper is disposed to describe any such case of predictive failure which does not lead to the refutation of the theory concerned as one in which that refutation has been avoided. To reinforce his portrayal of the refutation, or the attempted refutation, of major scientific theories as the rational core of scientific practice, Popper treats the so-called practice of avoiding a refutation as untypical of science, and much so-called avoidance he dismisses as unscientific or pseudo-scientific. I argue that his notion of avoiding a refutation is incoherent. Popper is further driven to believe that such avoidance is possible, however, because he conflates sentences with propositions and propositions with propositional beliefs. Also, he wishes to avoid being saddled with the relativisim that is a consequence of his weak account of refutation as discorroboration. Popper believes that ad hoc hypotheses are the most important of the unscientific means of avoiding a refutation. I argue that his account of such hypotheses is also incoherent, and that several hypotheses thought to be ad hoc in his sense are not. Such hypotheses appear to be so largely because of Popper&#039;s use of rhetoric and partly because these hypotheses are unacceptable for other reasons. I conclude that to know that a hypothesis is ad hoc in Popper&#039;s sense does not illuminate scientific practice. Popper has also attempted to explicate ad hocness in terms of some undesirable, or allegedly undesirable, properties of hypotheses or the explanations they would provide. The first such property is circularity, which is undesirable; the second such property is reduction in empirical content, which is not. In the former case I argue that non-circularity is clearly preferable to non-ad hocness as a criterion for a satisfactory explanation or explanans, as the case may be, and in the latter case that Popper is barking up the wrong tree. Some cases of so-called avoidance are obviously not unscientific. The discovery of Neptune from a prediction based on the reasonable belief that there were residual perturbations in the motion of Uranus is an important case in point, and one that is much discussed in the literature. The manifest failure of astronomers to account for Uranus&#039;s motion did not lead to the refutation of Newton&#039;s law of gravitiation, yet significant scientific progress obviously did result. Retreating to WPF, Popper claims that Newton&#039;s law was prima facie refuted. In general, astronomers have never shared this view, and they are correct in not doing so. I argue that the law of gravitation would have been prima facie refuted only if there had been good reason at the time to believe as false what is true, namely, that an unknown trans-Uranian planet was the cause of those Uranian residuals. Knowledge of the trans-Uranian region was then so slight that it was merely a convenient assumption, one which there was little reason to believe was false, that the known influences on Uranus&#039;s motion were the only such influences. I conclude that in believing or supposing that it was this assumption that was false, rather than the law of gravitation, Leverrier and Adams, the co-predictors of Neptune, were acting rationally and intelligently. Popper&#039;s commentators offer a variety of accounts of the alleged practice of avoiding a refutation, and of this case in particular. I analyse a sample of their accounts to show how common is the acceptance of some of Popper&#039;s basic mistakes, even amongst those who claim to reject his falsificationism, and to display the effects on their accounts of this acceptance of his mistakes. Many commentators recognize that anomalies are typically dealt with by changes in the boundary conditions or in other of the auxiliary propositions employed. Where many still go wrong, however, is in retaining the presupposition of WPF which encouraged Popper to hold the contradictory view about anomalies in the first place. Thus Imre Lakatos and others, for example, have developed a &#039;siege mentality&#039; about major scientific theories; they see them as under continual threat of refutation from anomalies, and so come to believe that dogmatism is essential in science if such theories are to survive as they do. I examine various such doomed attempts to reconcile Popper with the history of science. It is a common failure in this literature to conflate or to fail to see the need to distinguish a belief from a supposition, and an epistemic reason from a pragmatic reason. I argue that only if one does draw these distinctions can one give an adequate account of how anomalies are rationally dealt with in science. The other important strand in Popper&#039;s thinking about &#039;avoidance&#039; of refutation which has seriously misled some of his commentators is his unfounded belief in the dangers of ad hoc hypotheses. I examine the accounts that a sample of such commentators provide of the trans-Uranian planet hypotheses of Leverrier and Adams. These commentators imply or assert what Popper only hints at, namely, that there is something fishy about this hypothesis. I provide a further defence of the rationality of entertaining this hypothesis at the time. I conclude with a few remarks about Popper&#039;s dilemma in respect of scientific practice and his long standing emphasis on refutations."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Nonhierarchical methods group objects into a collection of clusters &quot;K&quot;. Monthly factor data for each location collected over 5 years were used in the cluster analysis. The group mean monthly factors of the groups that were determined and the monthly factors of each location were applied to the appropriate randomly selected daily traffic count.

Statistical analysis was used to determine the &quot;best&quot; method for deriving monthly factors and also provided the best estimates of AADT. From the results of this analysis, it was determined that the two primary groups derived from using four clusters were the best and the most stable of all the variations used in the analysis. The statistical analysis revealed that the results obtained from using the grouped mean monthly factors of this variation were marginally better than those from the other variations.

Carr. Seasonal differences in the relative monoterpene content of developing buds and I-year-old foliage were followed. To test the hypothesis that a resistant chemotype to the white pine weevil, Pissodes strobi, Peck could be identified, the relative composition of monoterpenes between weevil-susceptible and apparently resistant trees were compared. In second-year foliage of trees from the university of B.C. Research Forest, Maple Ridge, B.C., a-pinene and camphene levels increased in May and returned to their original levels by September. Myrcene, isopentenyl isovalerate and camphor levels decreased in May. Isopentenyl isovalerate and camphor levels increased over the summer but myrcene continued to decline, offsetting rising levels of 3-carene and p-pinene. To obtain representative monoterpene spectra, samples should be taken after September 30, when trees are dormant for the winter. There was significant developmental variation in buds from 20 trees from Sayward, B.C. a-Pinene and 0-pinene were prominent initially and then declined, while myrcene increased to become the major volatile component of the elongating buds. 0-Phellandrene levels declined and then increased as the season progressed. There was no significant difference in percent monoterpene compositioa between buds from resistant and susceptible trees at Sayward. Foliar analysis of trees from Nootka Island, Sayward and the Nass River, B.C. revealed significant differences between 34 resistant and 55 susceptible trees. The resistant trees, as compared to susceptible trees, had significantly lower amounts of isoamyl isovalerate at all 3 sites and lower amounts of isopentenyl isovalerate at 1 site. Amounts of a-pinene, p-pinene, camphene and camphor were significantly higher in some resistant trees but these differences were not consistent between sites. The cortical monoterpene spectra of 4 resistant Sitka spruce from the Green Timbers Nursery, Surrey, B.C. were compared to those of 9 clones from their grafted scions at the B.C. Forest Service, North Road Laboratory, Victoria, B.C. 3-Carene and terpinolene were higher in the parent trees, while a-pinene and p-phellandrene-limonene were present in significantly higher amounts in the clones. .These differences suggest that if breeding programs for resistance to the white pine weevil were initiated, a broader spectrum of resistant characteristics should be employed, than simply the monoterpene chemotype.

When these cultures are grown from preinvolution mice, the majority of the cells arrange themselves into networks with long cytoplasmic interconnections between the cells. In cultures from older mice, cellularity is considerably reduced especially of the cells with processes. Correspondingly, in the post involution cultures an increased proportion of cells grow as confluent carpets of paving stones (1,2). The present study was carried out a) to Identify which cells each of these are and b) to use these cultures to test the hypothesis that involution, as an accelerated form of aging may result from failure to repair damaged DNA. For cell identification we used fluorescent antibody staining, and for studies of DNA repair, autoradiography of unscheduled DNA synthesis after irradiation with UV. Cortical epithelial cells turned out to be those with decreased growth in cultures from aging mice, but the cells which remain continue to repair UV-induced damage to their DNA."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .
